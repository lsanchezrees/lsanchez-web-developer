		<ul>
			<li>About me: This will focus on my interests as a developer.</li>
			<li>Skills:  This will list skills I've learned or have from other jobs in the past.</li>
			<li>Experience:  the experience section will talk about previous experience, including IT experience before web design.</li>
			<li>Interests/hobbies:  this will be more about my personal interests and hobbies.  This will have a background image.</li>
			<li>Contact form:  This will be a contact form with a space for name, email, and comments.</li>
