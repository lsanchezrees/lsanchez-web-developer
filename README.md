## Milestone 1 feedback

Your code is extremely readable and well indented; great job! If you're going to be working within a corporation or larger company your fellow coders will love you for your ability to organize your code. Your gitignore and directory structure look great. The only change you may want to consider is moving your index.php into your public_html directory.

You've done a great job targeting a general employer type that you're targeting, however, is there a specific sector you'd prefer to work within? Do you prefer a company that focuses on physical goods, software, manufacturing, etc? If not, that's totally fine. Your preferences will most likely change as time elapses and you become more familiar with web development.

Your persona section is overall very good, however, we want you to be more specific in regards to the technology being used. Does this hiring manager have an iPhone, Android, Windows or Blackberry (does blackberry still exist?...). 

Your HTML passed inspection by [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~lsanchezrees%2Flsanchez-web-developer%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php), and overall you've done an excellent job with milestone 1! You pass with a [tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're free to move on to [milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

## Milestone 2a Feedback:

### Feedback 
Good job on Milestone 2a. Your directory structure is correct. You only have a few errors in your HTML https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~lsanchezrees%2Flsanchez-web-developer%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-2.php. I also really like your content strategy, and it should work great for PWP. The wireframes look great and I like how simple and straight to the point they are. Feel free to start working on milestone 2b whenever you are ready. 

### Fixes

You did not submit your final changes on milestone 2a to github. Technically we only grade what is on github. If I were to do so I would have had to give you a Tier I since you have no wireframes, which would have been a shame. Since this your first offense I am going to let it slide, but please remember to commit and push before turning in assignments. 

### Grade Tier III
