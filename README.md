## Milestone 1 feedback

Your code is extremely readable and well indented; great job! If you're going to be working within a corporation or larger company your fellow coders will love you for your ability to organize your code. Your gitignore and directory structure look great. The only change you may want to consider is moving your index.php into your public_html directory.

You've done a great job targeting a general employer type that you're targeting, however, is there a specific sector you'd prefer to work within? Do you prefer a company that focuses on physical goods, software, manufacturing, etc? If not, that's totally fine. Your preferences will most likely change as time elapses and you become more familiar with web development.

Your persona section is overall very good, however, we want you to be more specific in regards to the technology being used. Does this hiring manager have an iPhone, Android, Windows or Blackberry (does blackberry still exist?...). 

Your HTML passed inspection by [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~lsanchezrees%2Flsanchez-web-developer%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php), and overall you've done an excellent job with milestone 1! You pass with a [tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're free to move on to [milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
